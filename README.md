# advantages of Qt freamwork
QT offer us a solid inter connection between forntend and backend languages, and give us a cross platform application on top of it
and the easyest way to connecet interuption ( event ) 
*Connect SIGNAL AND SLOT* this is the real juice of QT that you will not have it in other languages 

## backend C / C++
with C++ we ensure low level performance access, so it will be 100% *effance*
and latest feautures of modern langauges same as JAVA, C#
## frontend QML
with qml you can create anything and everything, there is really no limit, the only limite is your imagination
it's mix of HTML and CSS, you can use javascript to add some functionalltiy
what is special about this frontend language ( vs html + css ) is that the compoment that you use are C++ classes
so it's 100% perfomance, you can build a game with 60 fps with it
